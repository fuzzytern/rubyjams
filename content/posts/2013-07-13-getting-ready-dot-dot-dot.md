Hey everyone, this is the first attempt to help Ruby enthousiasts gather for evening coding jams in Copenhagen, Denmark. If you're reading this and don't live in Copenhagen, you can check [this](https://github.com/fuzzytern/rubyjams) out and create your own RubyJams group in your area in minutes.

As far as Copenhagen is concerned, our current needs are:

- People - this is just me at the time of this post
- A venue - preferably somewhere we can stay at least until midnight once a week, though it's also possible to change every week...
- Ideas on how to make this happen - because this is just one man's idea with plenty of room for improvement

Please get in touch asap if you want to help to make this a reality.
