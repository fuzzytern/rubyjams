Check the date and place of the next meeting in the <a href="#updates">updates </a>section.</p><h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2><p>Unleashing your full potential at developing ruby code requires practice and reflection. Whether you are an advanced Ruby engineer, a casual web developer migrating from another technology or even never wrote a single line of code, the purpose of this group is to make the challenging journey of ruby development fun, exciting and rewarding.</p><h2 id="form">Form</h2><p>Once a week, we organise an evening coding session, where everyone is free to do whatever they want: exercises, pair programing, project development etc... We'll begin each session with an informal (and optional) check-in to get to know each other and to encourage collaboration. The program we follow is improvised as members find new challenges to take and share their ideas, just like a musician would contribute to a jam by playing a few notes.</p><h2 id="membership">Membership</h2><p>There is no cost or other specific requirements to join RubyJams. Everyone showing up at one of the meetings is a member, until they stop showing up for 4 consecutive weeks or decide to leave. Members participate in the organising of RubyJams events (finding venues, booking a room, organising a specific event etc...) on a voluntary basis.</p><h2 id="updates">Updates</h2><article><h2><a href="/2013/07/03/test/">My first post</a></h2><aside>Posted at 3 July 2013</aside><h4 id="hey">HEY</h4>
