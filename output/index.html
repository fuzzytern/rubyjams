Check the date and place of the next meeting in the <a href="#updates">updates </a>section.</p><h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2><p>Unleashing your full potential at developing ruby code requires practice and reflection. Whether you are an advanced Ruby engineer, a casual web developer migrating from another technology or even never wrote a single line of code, the purpose of this group is to make the challenging journey of ruby development fun, exciting and rewarding.</p><h2 id="form">Form</h2><p>Once a week, we organise an evening coding session, where everyone is free to do whatever they want: exercises, pair programing, project development etc... We begin each session with an informal (and optional) check-in to get to know each other and to encourage collaboration. The program we follow is improvised as members find new challenges to take and share their ideas.</p><h2 id="membership">Membership</h2><p>There is no cost or other specific requirements to join RubyJams. Just turn up and jam with us. Everyone showing up at one of the meetings is a member, until they stop showing up for 4 consecutive weeks or decide to leave. Members participate in the organising of RubyJams events (finding venues, booking a room, organising specific events etc...) on a voluntary basis.</p><section class="updates"><h2 id="updates">Updates</h2><article><h2><a href="/2013/07/13/getting-ready-dot-dot-dot/">Getting ready...</a></h2><aside>July 13, 2013</aside><p>Hey everyone, this is the first attempt to help Ruby enthousiasts gather for evening coding jams in Copenhagen, Denmark. If you’re reading this and don’t live in Copenhagen, you can check <a href="https://github.com/fuzzytern/rubyjams">this</a> out and create your own RubyJams group in your area in minutes.</p>

<p>As far as Copenhagen is concerned, our current needs are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>People - this is just me at the time of this post</li>
  <li>A venue - preferably somewhere we can stay at least until midnight once a week, though it’s also possible to change every week…</li>
  <li>Ideas on how to make this happen - because this is just one man’s idea with plenty of room for improvement</li>
</ul>

<p>Please get in touch asap if you want to help to make this a reality.</p>
