<!-- #Idea -->

The purpose of this repository is to make it straightforward for anyone to start a ruby user group where they live.
This is a website built with [Nanoc](http://nanoc.ws) that was originally used to start the RubyJams initiative in Copenhagen. It features a homepage presenting the RubyJams group and its ambitions, as well as a blog and a link section for relevant resources. If you're not in Copenhagen and want to set up something similar just follow these straightforward steps:

1. Fork RubyJams and tweak the content if needed to match the needs of your group
2. Deploy it to some domain. You can get *city.rubyjams.org* for free under certain conditions (see note below).
3. Find people and a place. E.g. create a post on the blog saying you're looking for a place and calling for people to join.
4. Make it happen. E.g. create a post on the blog where you indicate the date and the place of the first jam.
5. Congrats, you're done. Make sure to keep the blog up to date (hopefully you have plenty of people keen to take on that task now)

Note: It's up to you and your group to decide whether you want to keep any affiliation with RubyJams on your website. If you share the same purpose and vision, we recommend that you keep the *purpose* and *membership* sections of the home page intact, as well as keeping the name RubyJams for the group. This will help us create a coherent international ruby community based on common principles. This will also enable you to register your website under the form of *city.rubyjams.org* for free.

Note 2: The whole concept is at its very early steps. Please feel free to make any suggestions by amending this README file (in a PR) or by contacting me at nicolas@cybercrumbs.net.
